          <h3>About Humanism</h3>
          <p>Jai Constitution! Humanism is not just vague sentiments. It is a clear, concrete way of life. Humanism is the assertion of human dignity and the recognition of human needs, desires, and rights. It is a life-affirming philosophy that places humans at the center of moral concern. We believe in cultivating respect, love, and compassion for one another, making it central to our beliefs and actions.</p>

          <h3>About Democracy</h3>
          <p>Democracy is about the people having the power and being governed by their own elected representatives. Democracy is a system where equal rights are afforded to all citizens, allowing them to participate directly or indirectly in the election of leaders and policies. It is a method of governance where the voice of the people is heard and acted upon.</p>
        <p>The real power of a democracy lies in ensuring that individual rights and freedoms are protected, and every citizen has the ability to contribute to the society in a meaningful way.</p>

          <h3>Alcohol Consumption</h3>
        <p>Ponds are a vital part of our ecosystem. They play an important role in maintaining biodiversity, providing water for irrigation, and supporting various plant and animal life. The preservation of ponds is essential to maintain the balance of nature and protect aquatic life.</p>
        <p>Efforts should be made to prevent pollution and encroachments on these natural bodies of water. Conservation initiatives that aim to restore and protect ponds are necessary for the well-being of the environment and future generations.</p>

          <h3>Gender Equity</h3>
          <p><p>We strive to create a world where gender equity is the norm. We work towards providing equal opportunities and rights for all genders, ensuring that everyone is treated with fairness and respect in every aspect of life, whether personal, professional, or social.</p></p>
          <p>True gender equity requires dismantling the social and cultural barriers that have historically led to discrimination against women, girls, and gender minorities. It is crucial to ensure that all people have the same rights, freedoms, and opportunities.</p>

          <h3>Environmental Protection</h3>
          <p>
        <p>Environmental protection involves safeguarding the natural environment and its ecosystems for future generations. This includes measures to reduce pollution, conserve resources, protect wildlife habitats, and combat climate change. Sustainable development practices should be adopted to ensure that human activity does not cause irreversible damage to the planet.</p>
        <p>Climate change, deforestation, pollution, and loss of biodiversity are major issues that require immediate attention. Every individual can contribute to environmental protection through actions like reducing waste, using renewable resources, and supporting policies that protect the environment.</p></p>

          <h2> Pamphlet Making & Distribution</h2>
          <p>
          Jai Constitution! A new generation of young people with spirit and love of nature and environment will emerge, if awareness and an action-plan for conservation of nature becomes a part of their thought and daily routine! We drafted this 12-point pamphlet exactly with that idea. A team of 14 students of Lovely Professional University (Jalandhar, Punjab) took part in this effort as a part of Community Development Project. The pamphlet is easy to understand and act on. We will print and distribute this pamphlet ensuring that it would reach every high school student in both Telugu states. It should reach some students and teachers, through You! Please share it with nature-lovers in your contacts. We appeal to teachers to ensure that their students read this aloud in the class. Your work is critical in this endeavor! Nature - Environment - Sustainability - Democracy are inseparable!

          <h2>Organ Donation</h2>
          <p>
          Humanists are enlightened, forever-young and benevolent persons! Age is not a barrier for them in serving the nation. Our Hero today is Mr Benguluru Prasad, age 71 (B. 10.07.1953)! He stared living a humanist way of life about two years ago. It transformed him. There were great changes in thoughts, habits and daily routine. He became free of all superstitions and imaginary fears! He got belief in self and self-confidence. Humanism taught him increasing potential and reaching his potential! He is a new person now. He donated his body, with all useful organs for those who need them today, 05 July'24. This was formally done in a 'Birthdays in July' celebration held in the Dammayiguda-Nagaram senior citizens welfare association (See Photo).
He is a great inspiration to citizens, especially young people! Humanism, a way of life, gives meaning, purpose and goal for life. We commend Mr. Prasad for believing in and practicing Humanism! 'We are proud of you sir'!  
‘Caring & Sharing’ is the essence of Humanism!
Poverty is man-made! Humanism is the solution
